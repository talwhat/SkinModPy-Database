SkinModPy Database
===

## Info
This is a database for [SkinModPy](https://github.com/talwat/skinmodpy)'s overlays!

So, all the overlays in the program are stored here.

## Adding overlays
If you want to, you can add **your own overlays** to the program by contacting me!

You can do that by either:
* Messaging me on discord. *(Talwat#2277)*

* Making a pull request with the overlays you want to add.

* Opening an issue with the link of the overlays you want to add.

## Overlay Properties
Overlays should be the normal size of a minecraft skin *Which is 64x64*

**NOTE: Legacy skins or 64x32 skins are not supported, so please convert them.**

Also, the color `#FD00FE` removed from the final output, so keep that in mind.

This is so things like clothing can be overlayed properly, without the original skins clothing effects getting in the way, and allowing way less manuel tweaking.
